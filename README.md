# 🌸Sakura🌸

- 🖋 I’m currently an ASU student majoring in GIT. My dream is to be an Graphic/UIUX designer who can code websites and apps
- 🐱 I'm a cat lover
- 🇯🇵 I'm a Japanese, who was born and raised in Japan
- 💕 I love Kpop, K-dramas and anime

Although I have just started learning how to code, it is already fun. It is satisfying, especially when my codes turn into an actual layout and webpage that I wanted.
