  Hi guys. My name is...
  <h1>Sakura🌸</h1>

- 🖋 I’m currently an ASU student majoring in GIT. My dream is to be an Graphic/UIUX designer who can code websites and apps
- 🐱 (TMI) I'm a cat lover...
- 🇯🇵 I'm a Japanese, who was born and raised in Japan.(I've only been to the US once)
- 💕 I love K-drmas and anime
- 😅 I have just started learning code. A complete begginer. Please be nice to me...

Although I have just started learning how to code, it is already fun. It is satisfying, especially when my codes turn into an actual layout and webpage that I wanted.
